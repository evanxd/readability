                                    <p>I find both these definitions oddly restrictive. Insects have 6 legs and worms (in the primary sense) have none. The other senses of worm are also specific. There are many small creatures who do not fall into these categories. Centipedes definity have legs, and a lot more than six. Is there a common (not too scientific) word to refer to all small creatures?</p>

                                    <p>A <strong><a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bug">bug</a></strong> doesn't work, as is defined as</p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p><em>chiefly North American</em> A small <strong>insect</strong>:</p>

                                        <p><em>a thick green scum which crawls with bugs, centipedes, and worse</em></p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>Insect, not creature, not worm. Also note the exclusion of centipedes from the umbrella of bugs. In fact, Oxford defines <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/centipede">centipedes</a> exclusively in scientific terms.</p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>A <strong>predatory myriapod invertebrate</strong> with a flattened elongated body composed of many segments. Most segments bear a single pair of legs, the front pair being modified as poison fangs.</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>Although Oxford <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/insect">here</a> lists an informal sense of insect:</p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p><em>informal</em> Any small invertebrate animal such as a spider or tick.</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>It curiously drops this definition in the advanced learners' version. Moreover, it's reluctant to use the term in its own definition of <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/spider">spider</a>:</p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>An eight-legged <strong>predatory arachnid</strong> with an unsegmented body consisting of a fused head and thorax and a rounded abdomen. Spiders have fangs which inject poison into their prey, and most kinds spin webs in which to capture insects.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Bug</strong> is certainly what I would use, and what I would expect those around me to use. And I am American, so I think Oxford is simply wrong about how we use the word. Merriam-Webster, for instance, gives <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bug">the principal definition of bug</a> as</p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>1 a : an insect or other creeping or crawling invertebrate (as a spider or centipede)</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>This matches your desired usage perfectly. Note the near-reference to Scimonster’s suggestion of <em>creepy-crawlies</em> – Merriam-Webster here makes it pretty clear that <em>bug</em> is used as a more-formal <em>creepy-crawly</em>.</p>

                                    <p>That said, if we are being truly formal (read: technical), the third definition is the “formal” one:</p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>1 c : any of an order (<em>Hemiptera</em> and especially its suborder <em>Heteroptera</em>) of insects that have sucking mouthparts, forewings thickened at the base, and incomplete metamorphosis and are often economic pests —called also <em>true bug</em></p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>This fact is, however, outside entomology, not widely known, and would be regarded by most as trivia. By comparison, the specifics of <em>insect</em> are much more widely known, though I’d guess the majority of speakers are unlikely to care very much in practice – just because someone knows, or at least at one point learned, that insects have three body parts, six legs, etc., doesn’t mean they care to use the word so exactly. But many more know/care about <em>insect</em>’s specific definition than do about <em>bug</em>, as indicated by the fact that some entomologists have resorted to the phrase <em>true bug</em> for <em>Heteroptera</em>. Thus bug is very much my recommendation.</p>

This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include <strong>insects</strong>, crabs, lobsters and their kin, snails, clams, octopuses and their kin, starfish, sea-urchins and their kin, and <strong>worms</strong>.</p>

                                    <p>"Vermin" or "pests" can be any small creature, usually with a negative connotation, but including things as large as rats or even opossums. "Creepy-crawlies" is good but very informal. But as for "bug" -- scientifically, only a small subset of insects are bugs. But the word has expanded, and can now also mean an infection, or a computer glitch. I would argue that as long as the context doesn't imply you mean only insects, "bug" isn't actually wrong in informal English.</p>

                                    <p>I would say that in the Swedish language the word "kryp" have this meaning. Small creatures that is not built like us mammals, birds and fish. Non vegetable things that move around, but do not have a skeleton. (Or we just can't tell.)</p>

                                    <p>A direct translation to English would be "crawl". But "crawlers" would perhaps correspond more closely to how it is perceived.

                                    <p><strong>Wug</strong> is a portmanteau of <em>worm</em> and <em>bug</em>. It's not very common though, and might need to be explained.</p>

                                    <p>A Google search for <a href="https://www.google.co.il/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=wug%20worm%20bug" rel="nofollow"><code>wug worm bug</code></a> reveals hundreds of results, many from books on taxonomy. I couldn't just search for <code>wug</code> because it has other meanings as well.</p>

                                    <p>This is either very informal or very formal -- i can't quite tell. :P</p>
