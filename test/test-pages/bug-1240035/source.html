Using the Gospel, I will show that it approves its own validity as God's word.</p><p class="P3">Certainly we cannot simply conclude that the Gospel is true just because it claims to be true. If that were so, then any number of ancient texts from various cultures would have an equally valid claim. However, we can infer something from the fact that the Gospel asserts its own validity: namely that it cannot be half-true. If the Gospel is something only near to the truth, then its assertion to be errorless and thus God's word should make us believe that it truly is errorless. By contrast, if it were not near to the truth, it would be made even farther from the truth by its own assertion of divine authorship while containing untruths. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span>” (Mt. 24:35) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2"> “</span><span class="Bible">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span>” (Mrk. 13:31)  </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.</span>” (Luk. 21:33)</p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.</span>” (Jn. 14:26) </p><p class="P3">As they were reminded by the Holy Spirit, the authors of the Gospels described the words of Jesus exactly and without errors.</p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit.</span>” (Rom. 9:1)</p><p class="P3">Peter equates Paul's letters with former (Old Testament) scriptures: (2Pet. 3:16) “<span class="Bible">as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things.

The reason being, oftentimes the New Testament refers to the Old Testament as a proof text for many of its claims. Here are some examples:</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">For most assuredly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.</span>” (Mt. 5:18) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.</span>” (Luk. 16:17)</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. …</span>” (Mt. 1)</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">… for thus it is written through the prophet…</span>” (Mt. 2:5) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet.</span>” (Mt. 12:15)  </p><p class="P3">See also Mt. 12:17; Mt. 3:3; 4:7; 4:14-16; 8:17; 13:14; 13:35; 15:7-8; 21:4-5; 21:42; 22:32; 22:43-44; 27:9-10; Mrk. 1:2-3; Mrk. 7:6-7; 12:10-11; 12:36; 14:27; Luk. 1:55; 1:70; 2:23; 3:4-6; Luk. 7:27 </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">He said to them, ‘This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.’</span>” (Luk. 24:44) </p><p class="P3">cf.

For instance, it records how Christ died, yet goes on to proclaim He is alive and will never die again. To understand this dichotomy regarding the resurrection, which is one of the foundational elements of the Christian faith, we need the God's word resolution of this as well as other supposed contradictions. The scripture refers to Jesus as the firstborn from the dead, meaning he is the first person who will ever die that will never die a second time. Jesus established the pattern where he lived, died then lived again, never to die.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.</span>” (Jn. 1:1-2)</p><p class="P3">This passage plainly refers to Jesus Christ, who St. John identified by the use of the word “logos,” (literally “word” in the English language) the deity of ancient Greek philosophers. Although I am not quite certain, I think this can also be applied to any part of God's word, including the Gospel. Thus I conclude that the Gospel should follow the same pattern as Christ himself: the Gospel lives, dies, and is resurrected.</p><p class="P3">This means that our first interpretation of a passage lives for a period of time, but then dies when we realize that our first understanding was wrong. Then, after a period of time, it should resurrect! When this occurs it means that our first understanding was correct, it just was not compatible with our overall philosophy.</p><p class="P3">I submit that the New Testament is inherently filled with things which look like contradictions when in reality, all it is doing is following this life-death-resurrection pattern, which is nothing more than seemingly improbable combinations of things. In human logic, life is not compatible with death, but the Gospel teaches about resurrection, that is, merging two seemingly incompatible things (life and death) together.</p><p class="P3">You should try to always follow this life-death-resurrection pattern when interpreting the Gospel, otherwise you too will easily fall into contradictions. However, I must confess that I have not always followed this pattern, because my knowledge of the Bible is not perfect.</p><p class="P3">One may reasonably ask the question: If a passage of the Gospel dies, and then resurrects, can it ever die again? No, it can't be: “<span class="Bible">knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!</span>” (Rom. 6:9) This means we don't need to overload our mind with repeated deaths and resurrections again in our understanding of the Gospel. So the pattern life-death-resurrection in our understanding of the Gospel is simple enough for us to understand.</p><h2 class="P14"><a id="a__Prosperity_Gospel_as_an_example"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3876_504194157"/>Prosperity Gospel as an example</h2><p class="P3">Some Christian denominations, primarily Charismatics and Pentecostals, believe in the Prosperity doctrine or Prosperity Gospel. Other denominations, both evangelical and liberal, such as Methodists or Baptists, reject this teaching and even say that it is a heresy.</p><p class="P3">For those who may be unaware of what this teaching is; the <span class="T1">Prosperity Gospel</span> is the belief that faith, when combined with following certain commandments, primarily those involving giving money to God’s work or those who need it, results in making the giver  prosperous, not only in heaven but also in this world. This prosperity takes the form or earthly wealth and influence.</p><p class="P3">Proponents of this doctrine point to Bible verses, such as the well-known “blessing of Abraham” (who was a rich man by the standards of his day). Likewise, opponents quote other Bible verses to support their case.</p><p class="P3"><span class="T4">Provided our faith is correct,</span> I do not doubt that with God's help we can obtain everything we request. “<span class="Bible">Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span>” (Mt. 26:53);  “<span class="Bible">… how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him</span>” (Mt. 7:11); “<span class="Bible">All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.</span>” (Mt. 21:22); “<span class="Bible">Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them.</span>” (Mrk. 11:24); “<span class="Bible">Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.</span>” (Jn. 14:13); “<span class="Bible">If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.</span>” (Jn. 15:7); “<span class="Bible">… that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span>” (Jn. 15:16); “<span class="Bible">… Most assuredly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</span>” (John 16:23)</p><p class="P3">During the first few years after my conversion to Christ I lived in extreme poverty. Things were so bad I was afraid I would die of hunger. <span class="T11">Even later when I</span> believ<span class="T11">ed</span> the Prosperity doctrine and <span class="T12">was </span>asking God to give me money, I wasn’t receiving the promised blessings. I was in conflict with everybody, because I was constantly quarreling about the Bible with anyone who would listen. The verses are plain in their promises, so if they were not evident in my life the problem is not the bible, rather my faith was wrong. (Or do you think having the right faith leads to a meaningless death by starvation?) I could be not a preacher, because if I preached in a church, all of my sermons would be “how to behave in such a way as to conflict with everyone and die of hunger.” I was living a life of following a self-contradictory doctrine. It was all about me: “<span class="Bible">For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord. He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</span>” (James 1:7-8)</p><p class="P3">Now I have no doubt that if a person’s faith is correct and they pray for money then God will answer.</p><p class="P3">The question is should we ask God to give us large sums of money? Should we practice the commandments of prosperity for the sake of prosperity?</p><p class="P3">It looks like that Gospel indicates that the answer is a resounding <span class="T4">no!</span> “<span class="Bible">But having food and clothing, we will be content with that. But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.</span>” (1Tim. 6:8-9)</p><p class="P3">This verse is the <span class="T1">death</span> of the Prosperity doctrine.</p><p class="P3">But remember, in the Gospel death is followed by a resurrection! “<span class="Bible">Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</span>” (Jam. 1:2-4) In this passage, “various” includes the temptation of richness. So when God gives us richness we should accept it with great joy. We should lack in nothing (be rich) according to the above Bible quote. Also, “<span class="Bible">Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.</span>” (Jam. 1:12)</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position; and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away</span>” (Jam. 1:9-10). This is the reverse of what we thought.</p><p class="P3">Those who have riches should understand that they are tempted more than those who have little or nothing. “<span class="Bible">Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you.</span>” (Jam. 5:1)</p><p class="P3">One may ask: Why does the author believe that we should come into temptations? The answer is found in James 1:2-4 quoted above. I will say more about going through temptations later in this book.</p><p class="P3">See chapter <a href="#__RefHeading__60_1535231160">Chapter 9 </a> for more on the Prosperity Gospel.</p><h1 class="P24"><a id="a_Chapter_5_Christ_and_God"><span>Chapter 5 </span></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3878_504194157"/><a id="chap_Christ"/>Christ and God</h1><h2 class="P17"><a id="a__Foreword"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3880_504194157"/>Foreword</h2><p class="P3">Obtaining a human understanding of God is difficult. At times it seems that a human can only reason about God through the use of analogies.</p><p class="P3">Many different analogies for God have been proposed to help explain God. Some of them are quite helpful while others are completely pointless. </p><p class="P3">The first analogy which comes to mind concerns a comparison of God to a human being. This is natural for Abrahamic religions as it states “<span class="Bible">God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” </span>(Ge. 1:26).</p><p class="P3">The comparison of God with a man is a good analogy, but it lacks a proper explanation of Holy Trinity. It was proposed that the trinity is similar to a mentally disordered person having three personalities, but in my opinion this analogy is entirely pointless.</p><p class="P3">I propose a different analogy to describe God. God is similar to a <span class="T1">civilization</span>. To be sure, this is indeed a very deep analogy. In this analogy there is even a place for analogies of Christ, which is similar to a “contact” of a civilization that is to a less advanced civilization making <span class="T1">contact</span> with a more advanced one or to contact between parts of an advanced civilization and by comparing the Holy Spirit to the <span class="T1">technology</span> of a civilization. This is not to suggest we are able to come to a knowledge of the existence and properties of Christ and the Holy Spirit based solely on philosophical grounds without the help of the Bible; but nevertheless Christ and Holy Spirit (and therefore the Holy Trinity) have a natural place in this philosophy.</p><p class="P3">With this theology there is a good fit for mankind's purpose and position in the universe as being unlimitedly developed with God’s help.</p><p class="P3">As such, I consider a <span class="T1">civilization</span> to be the best known analogy for studying God.</p><p class="P3">Let us examine some similarities and differences between a civilization and God.</p><p class="P5">Note that when speaking about civilizations and outside contact, I will make not mention of aliens from outer space, because we are mostly interested in the common properties of civilizations and God, not in how a civilization may be split into parts. “<span class="Bible">For there is no partiality with God</span>” (Rom. 2:11). This verse indicates that analyzing God through the use of an analogy of something split into parts may be not effective.</p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__God_as_a_civilization"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3882_504194157"/>God as a civilization</h2><p class="P3">I am using the word <span class="T1">universe</span> to refer to the totality of physical reality. In other words, the universe consists of anything that physically exists. This would include galaxies, stars, atoms, electrons, everything. I refer not only to the visible part of universe which astronomers can see, but the entire universe including hidden dimensions. Astronomers have long debated the size of the universe. The leading theory in vogue is that the universe is finite. However, I believe the universe is infinite because (as I demonstrate below) an infinite Christ lives inside the universe.</p><p class="P3">Consider the ramifications of an infinite Universe. Within it various civilizations have reached different levels of development.</p><p class="P3">Because the Universe is infinite, it is natural to assume the existence of civilizations at all possible levels of development. Extending this reasoning, we may conclude that there exist civilizations of infinitely high level of development.</p><p class="P3">The natural question arises, does there exist several different civilizations at this infinite level of development or is there only one united civilization at the infinite level of development. If we call a civilization with this infinite level of development <span class="T1">god</span>, this question gets reformulated: whether there are several different gods or one god? (More exactly, an infinitely developed civilization in the Universe is a representation of God, not God Himself. I will consider this below.)</p><p class="P3">Well, what do we mean when we say “there exists just one civilization possessing an infinite level of development”? We could split a civilization into multiple parts and call them different civilizations. So the key to this question is not <span class="T1">quantity</span> but <span class="T1">unity</span>. By this I mean that the question of whether there is only one god should be reformulated: are all the entities with this infinite level of development <span class="T1">united</span> with each other? Do they share one common business? Are they in peace with each other? Some translators of the Bible prefer to say “God is united” instead of “There is one God.”</p><p class="P3">In other words, when we say “there is one god” what we really mean is that all infinitely developed civilizations coincide. What do I mean when I say <span class="T1">coincide</span>? This is a hard question and I am not able to offer a precise definition. If we consider it from the civilizational viewpoint, this would be a social relation and social relations are difficult to be defined exactly. I'm going to attempt to describe some of these properties. First, all gods are at peace with each other. If we had two infinitely developed civilizations at war with each other, this would mean there are two different gods. The second aspect of God’s unity is that He is personal. This means He has a united opinion and makes united decisions. There are not several independent entities sitting around discussing issues like a cabinet meeting, hoping to reach a consensus. </p><p class="P3">According to the doctrine of Holy Trinity God has not one, but three persons. </p><p class="P3">In several key aspects God differs from what we call a civilization. For example, a civilization has a definitive time and place where it first began. Rome supposedly began when Romulus killed his brother Remus and founded the city on the Palatine Hill. The civilization that formed the United States had its beginning with the American Revolution. However, God is eternal. Despite these differences I will compare God with a civilization throughout the rest of this article.</p><p class="P3">Thus I conclude that God is similar to a highly developed civilization, yet He is highly united, personal, eternal, and infinite.</p><p class="P3">So I submit to you the following:</p><p class="P3">Postulate: The Universe is infinite.</p><p class="P3">Postulate: God exists.</p><p class="P3">Postulate: God is one or united.</p><p class="P3">Postulate: God is personal.</p><h2 class="P15"><a id="a__Christ"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3884_504194157"/>Christ</h2><p class="P3">If God is a civilization then Christ is its contact.</p><h3 class="Heading_20_3"><a id="a__Christ_is_electromagnetic_energy"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3886_504194157"/>Christ is electromagnetic energy </h3><p class="P3">Civilizations primarily engage in communication through the use of electromagnetic waves such as radio or television signals.</p><p class="P3">Since Christ is the mediator between God and man, it is natural to think of Christ as being similar to electromagnetic waves.</p><p class="P3">In fact, the Bible teaches that Christ is all of the electromagnetic waves throughout the Universe. </p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">… Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the light of the world…;</span>” (Jn. 8:12) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span>” (Jn. 9:5) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">I have come as a light into the world…</span>” (Jn. 12:46) </p><p class="P3">Waves in the electromagnetic spectrum are a picture of both Christ's incarnation in the Universe (Jn. 9:5; Jn. 12:46) as well as a full description of Christ (Jn. 8:12).</p><p class="P3">I understand this as meaning that electromagnetic waves of the Universe are a complete characterization of Christ. But note that Christ reaches outside of the Universe. He is only electromagnetic energy or something like it while He is in the world (Universe).</p><p class="P3">A curious reader may doubt my interpretation of Matthew 5:14, “<span class="Bible">You are the light of the world,</span>” and (Ephesians 5:8 “<span class="Bible">For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord…</span>” Are the ones Jesus is speaking to in these passages also electromagnetic waves of the Universe? Indeed they are.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">… made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</span>” (Eph. 2:6) </p><p class="P3">The word “sit” is in the Aorist tense (a Greek grammatical form) that is in perfect past time. This means we are already in the heavens. This may seem counter-intuitive because we do not feel like we are in the heavens. I conclude that we currently exist in the heavens as electromagnetic waves. It can be said that we, as one body, form Christ (thus Christ may be considered as an organization or a collective). But Christ is Christ only without partiality. We are part of the universe’s electromagnetic waves with partiality because every one of us is a part of the electromagnetic waves of the heavens.</p><p class="P3">How can we, being people, also be electromagnetic waves in the heaven? I understand this as being the existence of one-to-one correspondence between the structure of the electromagnetic waves in the heavens and us living on earth. I think the same applies to Christ's human nature. In the body of a man, Jesus mapped the structure of the light of the Universe. It is hard to believe and may seem absurd, but this what the Gospel requires us to believe. I continue to wonder what may be the reason for this one-to-one correspondence.</p><p class="P3">With Christ being the electromagnetic waves of the universe it then logically follows that the universe must be infinite because Christ is infinite. Thus the universe contains more than just the visible portion which is known to be finite.</p><p class="P3">Christ is also called logos (word) in the Bible because He is the Word of God (in the form of electromagnetic waves).</p><h3 class="Heading_20_3"><a id="a__Wisdom_and_truth"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3888_504194157"/>Wisdom and truth</h3><p class="P3">Postulate: The knowledge of a highly developed civilization will more than likely be in the form of the electromagnetic waves. </p><p class="P3">In other words, Christ is God’s wisdom.  </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Christ is … the wisdom of God.</span>” (1Cor. 1:24)</p><p class="P3">This means just two simple things:</p><p class="P7">- The word of God is wise.</p><p class="P7">- God has imparted all His wisdom in His word;</p><p class="P6">that is Christ is the entirety of the wisdom of God, not just parts (that exist in various forms and locations) of full wisdom. That Christ is the full content of God is also declared in the following verses. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him.

In other words, Christ is the logical truth. When Jesus speaks on a subject, it is the final word on it. He never has to go back and make corrections when “new evidence comes to light.” </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life.’</span>” (Jn. 14:6)  </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible"><span class="T2">… </span></span><span class="Bible">Your word is truth.</span>” (Jn. 17:17)</p><p class="P3">I mentioned above that an infinite developed civilization is God, but that is actually not quite so. In Christianity this infinitely developed civilization in the Universe is called <span class="T1">Christ</span>. I will argue below that Christ is God, but only conditionally.</p><h3 class="Heading_20_3"><a id="a__Peace"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3890_504194157"/>Peace</h3><p class="P3">Which possible forms can a civilization take? It may be a peace treaty union. </p><p class="P3">Existence of one God may be understood as being the same as having complete peace between its parts. I said earlier that we are not able to precisely define the unity of God; but it is conceivable that this unity is the same as “peace in all aspects.” The unity consists of the interchange of information (“contact”) that is Christ.</p><p class="P3">A central concept in the issue of inter-civilization and intra-civilizational relations is <span class="T1">peace.</span> </p><p class="P3">According to the Bible, Christ is peace.  I think this is equivalent to saying that Christ is the unity of God.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="T3">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition, having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace; and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby. He came and preached peace to you who </span><span class="T3">were far off and to those who were near. For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.</span> <span class="T3">So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.”</span> (Eph. 2:13-19)</p><p class="P3">This means that Christ is far more than just the peace union for the entire Universe; He is the peace with God.</p><p class="P9">Peace is great in the sense that there is no easy way to prevent war. The measures necessary to prevent war are great. Christ is the set of measures taken (on the heavens) to prevent war. To prevent war it is necessary something as great as Christ. Thus it can be said that Christ is the prevention of war or absence of war.</p><p class="P3">A paradoxical outcome of this attribute is that a seemingly little thing such as the absence of war needs to be as great as Christ.</p><p class="P3">It can be compared to reading a newspaper headline “Peace is established, war is abolished”. That would be a very great headline.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">He said to them, ‘But who do you say that I am?’ Peter answered, ‘The Christ of God.</span>” (Luk. 9:20) </p><p class="P3">This means that Christ is the contact of God, the means through which God communicates with Himself. Christ lives by the Father; and the Father also lives by Christ. Thus, Christ is essential for the Father's existence. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? … Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</span>” (Jn. 14:10-11) </p><p class="P3">(Alternatively translated “I exist by the Father, and the Father exists by me”). Also Jn. 17:21.</p><p class="P3">Peace and wisdom are related: <span class="T1">Wisdom is internal peace.</span> When neurons are in a state of peace with each other, our brain would be cleverer than any brain! The peace of God is above (that is, more clever than) any mind (“surpasses all understanding”) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span>” (Phil. 4:7)</p><p class="P3">Note however: </p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">’Don’t think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn’t come to send peace, but a sword.  For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.  A man’s foes will be those of his own household.’</span>” (Mt 10:34-36)</p><h3 class="Heading_20_3"><a id="a__Death_and_resurrection_of_Christ"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3892_504194157"/>Death and resurrection of Christ</h3><p class="P3">What is the history of peace and war in the Universe?</p><p class="P3">With Christ being understood as the peace for the entire Universe, the death of Christ can be understood as the loss of peace and His resurrection as restoring peace once again.</p><p class="P3">According to Hebrews 7:37 Christ “died once for all.” This means that everyone has lost their peace (with God) until the return of Christ.</p><p class="P3">In other words, war has broken out throughout the entire Universe but afterward eternal peace comes.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!</span>” (Rom. 6:9) That means that war will never return.</p><h2 class="P15"><a id="a__Christ_is_God_conditionally"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3894_504194157"/>Christ is God conditionally</h2><p class="P3">The question “Is Christ God” is similar to asking if the sequence of digits such as 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3… is a real number. A real number can be expressed by such a sequence and then we could say that it is a real number, but only conditionally, depending on what we mean by real numbers. (Real numbers can be defined not only as sequences of digits but also in several other ways. For example, splitting a set of rational numbers into two parts. All these ways are equivalent but different.) In like manner, Christ is conditionally God; that is, whether He is or He isn't God depends on what we mean by God.</p><p class="P3">I will sometimes use the analogy of Christ with a civilization, and sometimes the analogy of God with a civilization, depending on the context.</p><p class="P3">The Trinity is (obviously) also conditionally God. When it comes to the Trinity it is particularly clear that it is God only in a conditional sense, because clearly in general God is not a set consisting of three elements.</p><p class="P3">The scriptures plainly proclaim Christ to be God in multiple verses. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible"><span class="T2">… </span></span><span class="Bible">Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever.

We would have trouble doing this, but a higher civilization would have the ability to move individual atoms inside of it. A force of their technology would come inside and move the individual atoms. By doing so, the object would behave like a gas.</p><p class="P3">The technology of God is called the <span class="T1">Holy Spirit</span> (the word “spirit” may mean a gas). This is the force which is able to enter the human body and move individual atoms to, among other things, cure disease.</p><p class="P3">It is believed by many Christians that every part of God's will is accomplished by a move of the Holy Spirit. Thus, the Holy Spirit is fully (conditionally) God.</p><p class="P3">Together with above description of Christ being conditionally God this forms the Holy Trinity consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p><p class="P3">The function of the Holy Spirit is <span class="T1">salvation;</span> that is repairing things, especially those things which are inside closed vessels that cannot be opened. This is because all things are done by God and the only things left in need of repair are broken things. Things that are not inside of closed vessels can be repaired by outside entities without the direct help of God.</p><p class="P3">The divinity of the Holy Spirit is a natural outcome in the civilizational consideration. Just as in our modern civilization the technology of the advanced civilization contains the totality of its knowledge. </p><p class="P3">The Holy Spirit is an active and live force: He <span class="T1">knows</span>: “<span class="Bible">… Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God’s Spirit.</span>” (1Cor. 2:11)</p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__Trinity"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3898_504194157"/>Trinity</h2><p class="P3">In this civilizational approach to describing God, the doctrine of Trinity does not look contradictory or paradoxical at all.</p><p class="P3">I define a <span class="T1">person</span> as something which speaks and hears. Different persons differ in what they say and hear.</p><p class="P3">For a civilization, we would not find it contradictory to have three distinct representative agencies. (An agency is a form of a person.) Yet all three would necessarily work in agreement with each other to properly represent the civilization. This is similar to how God having three persons is not a contradiction. Three persons of God act in complete agreement, so that God is not divided. </p><p class="P3">Note that because the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are different “agencies,” we may pray to each of them. We may also pray to God without specifying a particular person. However, Jesus said we are to pray to the Father.</p><p class="P3">Don't be tricked into thinking that I am suggesting the members of the Trinity differ only in what they speak and hear. There are other differences as well. For example, the Father is greater than the Son: “<span class="Bible">… the Father is greater than I</span>” (Jn. 14:28).</p><p class="P3">A prayer may be addressed to any of the three agencies officially representing God.

That is, He becomes the same as His Father.</p><p class="P3">Well, indeed Christ does not move. He is like a river that moves and does not move at the same time. In the same way Christ goes to His Father, but Christ does not move. The following Bible fragment says that Christ does not change:</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">And, ‘You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish, but you continue. They all will grow old like a garment does. As a mantle you will roll them up, And they will be changed; But you are the same. Your years will not fail.’</span>” (Heb. 1:10-12) We are children of God, this means that our natural course of development is to become like God (Jn. 1:12).</p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in him.” </span>(1Jn. 3:1-2)</p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t know him. Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.</span>” (1Jn. 3:1-2)</p><ol><li><ol><li><h2 class="P19"><a id="a__Son_of_man"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3902_504194157"/>Son of man</h2></li></ol></li></ol><p class="P3">Christ also is called <span class="T1">the son of man</span> in Gospel. This means that Christ is the final product of the development of mankind.</p><p class="P3">This is very good news because it means that the development of mankind will never be stalled but will continue without limit.</p><p class="P3">Jesus is the final result of the development of mankind. In other words, Jesus is just a guest from the infinitely far future.</p><p class="P3">It is not mankind that caused Christ to exist, instead the infinite development of mankind was made possible only by the coming of Christ to earth 2,000 years ago.</p><p class="P3">Now consider Revelation 10:6 (modified translation) “<span class="Bible">… there will be no longer time.</span>”</p><p class="P3">I think in this Bible verse the word <span class="T1">time</span> should be understood as an ordering of events in which preceding events can be the cause of following events but not vice versa. “No time” would mean that there is no longer an order to things, thus allowing subsequent events to affect those that come before it. In other words, unrestricted time travel is possible. I think there will be time in the sense that clocks and other physical objects dealing with time will continue to function. I think in this way, because physical objects continue to exist after Rev. 10:6 they would be unlikely to continue existing without time. Revelation 11:1 describes a temple with physical characteristics such as size; Rev. 11:13 describes an earthquake, etc. and even in Rev. 22, the last chapter of Apocalypse describes a river of water which cannot be without time as the river must flow.</p><p class="P3">A common scenario in science-fiction is members of a civilization returning back in time and changing its own development. I believe it is what Christ does with mankind.</p><p class="P3">For a loop in time this would be necessary to avoid contradictions such as the well-known paradox of somebody killing his own father before his birth by traveling in the past. I think God's commandments are intended to avoid such contradictions. For example, following the commandment “Don't kill” would make it impossible for a person to kill their father as in the mentioned paradox.</p><p class="P3">So after the second coming of Christ, we will take advantage of being part of this civilization of the highest possible development level without waiting an infinite amount of time for this. This is what “come of Christ” means.</p><p class="P3">It is worth mentioning that Islam has a very pessimistic attitude that “Allah is one and has no sons.” This would mean that no one is able to reach an infinite level of development and every development will become stalled at some stage. This agrees with the Muslim belief of a “materialistic” paradise filled with the pleasures of good foods and women, rather than the infinite development towards God offered by Bible.</p><ol><li><ol><li><h2 class="P18"><a id="a__Christ_is_our_hope"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3904_504194157"/>Christ is our hope</h2></li></ol></li></ol><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">… Christ Jesus our hope.</span>” (1Tim. 1:1) </p><p class="P3">I would instead translate this verse “<span class="Bible">… Christ Jesus our dream.</span>”</p><p class="P3">What is a dream?

It also means that our dream (the best we can hope for) is exactly what we will become when our salvation is fully accomplished. We will be exactly what we hope to be. What we dream here on Earth is laid up for us in the heavens: “<span class="Bible">because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens…</span>” (Colossians 1:5)</p><ol><li><ol><li><h2 class="P18"><a id="a__Christ_as_the_life"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3906_504194157"/>Christ as the life</h2></li></ol></li></ol><p class="P3">It is natural to think future development will only continue in the highest civilization, and that all other development outside of it will eventually stall at some point.</p><p class="P3">In other words, the highest civilization is exactly the (eternal) development.</p><p class="P3">In the Gospel development is called life.

This means that our characterization of being alive means that we are in Christ and Christ is our life.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">He who has the Son has the life.

Love is more than just peace, because peace is nothing more than the absence of war but love is something greater. If we have love <span class="T13">with</span> somebody we also necessarily have peace with him, but the reverse is not always true. Consider the case of North and South Korea today. They have had peace since the armistice of 1953, yet one would be a fool to say that both sides love each other.</p><p class="P3">As God is love, all of the following applies to God: </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Love is patient and is kind; love doesn’t envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails…</span>” (1Cor. 13:4-8)</p><p class="P3">Note that while God being love results in kindness to those who are in Him, He is cruel towards outsiders (those who are not in the Peace), as they are His military opponents. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">See then the goodness and severity of God.

We will consider the following case and take it to a logical contradiction:</p><p class="P3">At 10:00PM we get and read a piece of paper which we receive from the time machine. If the number is 0, then after an hour (at 11:00PM) we put a piece of paper with the number 1 to the time machine and transfer it back an hour. If the number we received at 10:00PM is 1 then we put the number 0 on a piece of paper and transfer it back an hour. </p><p class="P3">Now we have an obvious logical contradiction: If the number is 0 it is 1, if the number is 1 it is 0.</p><p class="P3">So for a time machine to work (not be contradictory), we must not put it to such a test.</p><p class="P3">It is similar to the biblical commandment not to test God. This I the reason I feel that God and time machines are similar, or perhaps even related.</p><p class="P3">If we were to attempt to test a time machine in this way either the machine will not work, or we would be removed from presence of the time machine by some force. Compare this with the following verses. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible"><span class="T2">… </span></span><span class="Bible">it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’</span>” (Mt. 4:7) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’</span>” (Luk. 4:12) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.</span>” (1Cor. 10:9)</p><p class="P3">Here is another example of a contradiction incompatible with the presence of a time machine. If you travel into the past and killed your own father before your conception, this would also lead to a contradiction. You were born (otherwise you cannot go into the time machine), but then if you kill your father you are not born. If you are not born then how can you go back in time and kill your father? Compare it with this verse: </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers…</span>” (1Tim. 1:9)</p><ol><li><ol><li><ol><li><h3 class="P33"><a id="a__Time_machine_as_a_hard_problem_solver"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3916_504194157"/>Time machine as a hard problem solver</h3></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p class="P3">A time machine can solve what is called NP-hard problems by mathematicians. Don't worry if you don't understand this term. I will explain it by use of a simple example, a chess game. (Don't worry, if you don't understand this example due to not knowing the rules, just believe my conclusion that if you are inside a time machine it can mysteriously make your brain unbeatable in chess competitions, just like you received revelations about every move. This is, of course, not only about chess but the idea that being inside of a time machine would enable you to receive revelations about all manner of difficult problems.)</p><p class="P3">The following is the way to win in chess using a time machine:</p><p class="P3"><span class="T19">1. </span>Receive a piece of paper with a record of a chess party from the time machine (see the future).</p><p class="P3"><span class="T19">2. </span>Start to play chess.</p><p class="P3"><span class="T19">3. </span>If you won (in the future) repeat the same moves you received in the piece of paper.</p><p class="P3"><span class="T19">4. </span>If you lost, make some other moves.</p><p class="P3"><span class="T19">5. </span>Using the machine return a piece of paper with the moves you made into the past.</p><p class="P13">Voila! The laws of logic lead to a scenario where you won (otherwise the future moves you received would be different than the moves you make while inside the time machine, but this is impossible because you are making the moves you received which are the same as moves you are doing).</p><p class="P3">Isn't this similar to receiving a revelation from God?</p><p class="P3">Another similarity between a time machine and God: God offers unlimited possibilities, and a time machine would likewise also present unlimited possibilities regarding technologies of the future.

However this explanation seems unlikely for me, and I instead suppose that Jesus’ decisions were limited by information received from human senses.

(Could it be otherwise with the electromagnetic waves of the Universe?)</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">But Jesus answered them, ‘My Father is still working, so I am working, too.’</span>” (Jn. 5:17) </p><p class="P3">So the theological theory that God presented Himself only as the Father, then only as the Son, and then only as Holy Spirit is wrong.

He always makes the right decisions and thus never could fall into a temptation. The answer is He was tempted so that others (people, angels, and so on) could see and learn from His responses to temptation.</p><p class="P3">This world and the evil in it exist with a purpose: Various situations present themselves for us should we be tempted. If we pass through a temptation, it is to set the world free from a particular wrong mode of action committed by certain kinds of persons. We need to overcome temptations with faith. Using our faith to set us free from a temptation is essential.</p><ol><li><ol><li><ol><li><h3 class="P33"><a id="a__Why_Jesus_refused_to_kneel_before_Devil"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3924_504194157"/>Why Jesus refused to kneel before Devil</h3></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory. He said to him, ‘I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.’</span>” (Mt. 4:8-9)</p><p class="P3">Jesus refused to accept this offer of the Devil.</p><p class="P3">Have you ever wondered why Jesus refused this offer by the Devil? Think about what he was asking. Satan was willing to give all of his earthly power to Jesus if he would only bow the knee one time. He didn’t even place any conditions on how long Jesus had to bow. Jesus could have bowed for less than a second and the devil would have given him the world. So why didn’t he take what would seem to be an incredible bargain? After all, couldn’t he have done so more as a formality like bowing in the presence of royalty without actually engaging in worship? All that would change would be the position of his body, not his heart. </p><p class="P3">I'd compare the interactions of Jesus Christ and the Devil to rivals in a chess game. One of the key elements of a chess game is the concept of sacrificing a valuable piece to obtain victory. It is in this light that the reason for Christ’s refusal can be inferred by the next move. “<span class="Bible">Then Jesus said to him, Satan, go behind me… </span>” (Mt. 4:10) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">Jesus answered him, ‘Get behind me Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’</span>” (Luk. 4:8) </p><p class="P3">By this bold statement Jesus reveals that he was the leader and all Satan can do is lead from behind. He said that the Devil will follow after him. What Jesus did here was take the time and attention of the Devil which he could have used to tempt others instead of wasting his time on Jesus who cannot be tempted. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</span>” (Heb. 2:18) </p><p class="P3">If Jesus were to have agreed to do what the Devil required, the Devil would then have been able to count his operation with Jesus as being complete and then go on to tempt other people instead of his focusing his attention on useless attempts to tempt Jesus.</p><p class="P3">Moreover, as these verses make clear, by Satan obeying Jesus (unwillingly) he was actually serving (“worshiped” as said in this Bible verse) Christ (as Christ is God). In other words by going after Jesus, Satan ended up having to do what Jesus required of him, despite his best attempts to do otherwise.</p><p class="P3">An important thing to note here is that although the Devil tried to <span class="Emphasis">tempt</span> Jesus, He didn't <span class="Emphasis">tempt</span> the Devil by causing him to have the wrong opinion on anything. All Jesus did was to spend time with the Devil. If your friend (or enemy) came to your house and did something to cause him to remain in your house as long as possible without enticing him to go against God’s commandments, this could not rightfully be called a temptation.</p><ol><li><ol><li><h2 class="P18"><a id="a__Jesus_was_in_the_Hell"><span/></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3926_504194157"/>Jesus was in the Hell</h2></li></ol></li></ol><p class="P3">After His death, Jesus was in Hell.

You could eat a fruit and instantly learn quantum mechanics.</p><p class="P3">One of the trees was the tree of knowledge of good and bad. This fruit injected knowledge into the human brain of how the brain itself functions (what it says is good and what is bad). This knowledge caused the brain to trick itself, effectively causing a short-circuit. This is somehow similar to giving a program the password to a computer, thus allowing inviting it in to destroy the normal functionality of the computer (as well as to destroy itself). More specifically, the brain starts seeking to do what makes it feel better rather than engaging in its proper purpose.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die.</span>” (Gen. 2:17) </p><p class="P3">Certainly, to die here is not referring to a physical death, instead it is talking about crashing the person’s “operating system.” </p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">… she took of the fruit of it, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.

They then collectively decided to no longer print or broadcast the names of the groups or persons who did the attack.

That being said, our purpose should not be just to get to heaven but to bring to heaven as little of our human character as possible. In other words, we need to hate our souls in this world.

Instead it speaks to others who are yet in slavery. It is God's word, but no longer is it a word to us. Through Gospel we were made to understand which commandments we failed to obey, but our task now is not to blindly attempt to follow the commandments, but keep them inside so that our inner nature follows the commandments of Gospel by itself. “<span class="Bible">Even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe…</span>” (Rom. 3:22)</p><p class="P3">The Gospel terminates itself. </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.</span>” (Rom. 7:6) </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible">For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.</span>” (Gal. 2:19) This means that for us to live for God we must die for the Gospel just as Gospel died (and was resurrected). We need to stop artificially following the commandments out of a sense of duty, but instead change our inward nature to conform to the commandments of Gospel.</p><p class="P3">Now we should interpret Gospel as it applies to itself (to Gospel).</p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">Where is the wise?

It can be called reincarnation. Likewise the spirit of Elijah has come onto Elisha (2Kin. 2).</p><p class="P3">This sometimes may take the form of a classic “reincarnation” where one person remembers the life of another dead person through the spirit.</p><p class="P3">Jesus said speaking of John the Baptizer, “<span class="Bible">If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.</span>” (Mt. 11:14) </p><p class="P3">This means that John was a reincarnation of Elijah for those people willing to believe that he was Elijah, but not for those unwilling to accept the spirit of Elijah.

Human logic causes us to suppose that since our life is important we should be worried about what to eat and drink in order to preserve our life. But Jesus tells to concentrate on more important things through the faith and if we do so God will provide the less important but critical things (food, drink, clothes) that support our life. If we <span class="Bible"><span class="T5">seek first God’s Kingdom and his righteousness, we will have “all these things” (food, drink, clothes</span></span>). </p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">“</span><span class="Bible"><span class="T2">…</span></span><span class="Bible">Jesus answered her, ‘Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,  but one thing is needed.

From this verse we know that being blessed with money isn't obligatory, there are people who may efficiently live without it.

My resolution is the following: A human thinks with his brain but the soul is a warranty for the body and a backup for the brain. This is a quite natural theory: God created people as agricultural robots “<span class="Bible">… a man to till the ground</span>” (Gen. 2:5) and created us with an eternal warranty and backup.

Revelation chapter 8 describes the <span class="Strong">catastrophe of the near future which is comparable only with a Great Diluvian</span>: A big comet which will fall onto the Earth and kill most of its inhabitants.</p><p class="P3">Whether the comet will fall before or after the Rapture of the Church is outside of the scope of my message.</p><p class="P3">Every word of this Bible fragment describes in details the catastrophe resulting from the falling comet. Unbelievers are not able to explain how the Author of Bible knows what will happen when a comet falls onto the Earth without having the scientific knowledge we have today. So let's proceed:</p><p class="P3">“<span class="T3">When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censor. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.</span>” (Rev. 8:1-3)</p><p class="P3">As we will see from what comes after, this censor is without a doubt a comet. There will be much incense (i.e. smoke and dust), when the comet enters the atmosphere and strikes the ground.</p><p class="P3">The censor (comet) is golden. A great many riches in heaven will fall down to earth for greedy people to be sacrificed! I think pieces of gold and golden dust will be spread everywhere, reflecting the Sun. The altar is also golden, indicating there will be very rich churches in the day of God's punishment! Gold is one of the heaviest metals. Greedy men will have a very heavy punishment for their sins against God. The heavier the comet the more destruction it causes.</p><p class="P3">It is the big sacrifice to cleanse the Earth from any kind of evil. The world lies in evil and it will be cleansed one more time as it was at the time of the Diluvian.</p><p class="P3">By the way, is it not wonderful that in the New World (after the Second Coming of Christ) that gold will be used for street covering instead of asphalt.</p><p class="P3">The question arises, how and from where will a golden comet appear? One possible answer is that it is the result of a collision between a golden asteroid and a normal comet or another asteroid. (Yes, astronomers have found an asteroid made entirely of gold, it is a fact!)</p><p class="P3">“<span class="T3">The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.</span>” (Rev. 8:4)</p><p class="P3">The burst caused by the velocity of the comet’s nucleus crashing to the Earth will be so great that part of the Earth's atmosphere will be ejected into outer space. As a result there will be less air on the Earth, making it more difficult to breathe.</p><p class="P3">Note that the comet is thrown by an angel in response to the prayers of the saints. This is not a random or an accidental catastrophe, but a planned attack by angels in direct response to people’s sins.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="T3">The angel took the censor, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.</span>” (Rev. 8:5)</p><p class="P3">This falling comet is fiery, becoming extremely hot as a result of friction in the atmosphere.  Unlike most meteors that burn up in the atmosphere, this comet is large enough that it will remain intact. Due to the intense heat it will be a fiery mountain falling from the sky. The impact will result in a seismic shockwave, causing massive earthquakes all around the globe of such ferocity that many of the world’s great cities will undoubtedly be <span class="T10">leveled.</span>  </p><p class="P3">There will also be an awful thunder (heard on the entire Earth), and so many people will become deaf. There will be lightnings, firstly giant lightnings as the comet causes horrific atmospheric disruptions between the comet and the Earth during the short time it is falling. These primary lightnings will produce massive electromagnetic pulses while generating such powerful radio waves that they will cause anything metallic to sparkle even at a a great big distance from the point of impact. Many power lines and electronic devices will be destroyed by the electromagnetic sparkling. Additionally, the atmosphere affected by the comet will produce many great and large thunderstorms. During the time it is crashing down to earth, there will be also other sounds but they will be heard not by human ears; instead powerful radio waves will directly enter the skull and into the brain, sounding inside and letting people know immediately of the cataclysm that had just occurred. This will enable them to hear of the falling comet immediately without waiting for the sound of thunders to pass in the distance!</p><p class="P3">These were just the introductory passages. Now let us read the rest of the details:</p><p class="P3">“<span class="T3">The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</span>” (Rev. 8:6-7)</p><p class="P3">Frequently a cloud of smaller objects of varying sizes will be found near comets. We can see these when a comet’s orbit nears the sun or a planet and the head is partially destroyed by gravity and the sun's heat. When the entire object enters the atmosphere these huge stones will fall to earth as fiery meteorites. Their velocity will be so intense it will seem as if a mass of cluster bombs has struck the earth. Upon impact they will be mixed with the blood of people and animals. The hot fragments will destroy and set on fire houses, cars, fields, anything it comes in contact with. The cosmic dust accompanying the comet will produce gigantic hailstones in the atmosphere. These hailstones, along with meteorites will kill millions and mix their blood. One third of the earth’s surface will be a firestorm!</p><p class="P3">These burning meteorites will also ionize the stratosphere and destroy the ozone layer which protects us from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. If somebody were to go outside without special protective equipment they will become blind and develop skin cancer in a short time. </p><p class="P3">A large portion of the world’s agriculture will be burned in the fires raging across the planet, but even worse will be the ultraviolet radiation that destroys all the green grass (including agricultural plants) crops and forests. So the next distress is massive amounts of famine, however there is no other country to turn to for help. Many people will kill each other and eat each other's flesh. </p><p class="P3">Because of the destruction of one third of the trees and all of the green grass, oxygen levels will begin to decrease making it even harder to breathe.</p><p class="P3">Satellites will be destroyed by the meteorite rain. This means there will be no means of communication such as the Internet, television or radio. In addition the power outages will mean not refrigeration and hospitals will be unable to provide proper care. Water will also become scarce due to not having power to run the pumping stations. </p><p class="P3">“<span class="Bible">The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood, and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.</span>” (Rev. 8:8-9)</p><p class="P3">By now, for any reasonable Bible reader it should be obvious that Revelation 8 describes a falling comet exactly as it is described.</p><p class="P3">The events of Revelation 8:8 do not happen immediately after the preceding verse, but in the middle of the meteorite rain. The burning mountain is the comet’s nucleus falling into one of the oceans. The words "big mountain" means that the nucleus will be comparable in size to Mt. Everest (8 km). The more the comet weight the greater the destruction. Previously I noted that the comet will be golden, but it is probably not as heavy as an 8 km piece of gold and is probably only partially golden.</p><p class="P3">The comet will breach a hole in the crust of the Earth, causing a new giant volcano to arise from the ocean. In the impact zone the water will become very heated because of the actual impact and the volcano.</p><p class="P3">In the region of the fall a large quantity of poisonous hydrogen sulfide will rise to the top of the ocean. Hydrogen sulfide is contained in both the lower levels of ocean water and at the bottom. Hydrogen sulfide is produced by certain kinds of bacteria. The poison, as well as the shock wave and increased temperature will kill life at the top levels living near the surface of the ocean and be replaced with bacteria which can live in with hydrogen sulfide. These bacteria are red and so the water will become red like blood. As a result, one third of the living animals in the ocean will die. Additionally the water will be stained red from the blood of the dead bodies of sea animals and fishes. The concentration of microorganisms in the water will be comparable to the concentration of cells in blood. In effect, water will become blood, just as the Bible says. Hydrogen sulfide is the substance which causes dead bodies to stink and bloat, so the very ocean will stink with the poison.</p><p class="P3">Super-tsunamis produced by the impact will destroy one third of the world’s navies besides the ships destroyed by the meteorites. Also, although for some reason the Bible doesn’t mention this, the tsunami’s will destroy many on-shore cities, killing those that survived the earthquakes. </p><p class="P3">Airplanes are perfect targets to be destroyed by meteorites, and one-third of all the airplanes will be also destroyed. It will be impossible to flee to a secure place from the zone of the greatest destruction.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="T3">The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters. The name of the star is called Wormwood. One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</span>” (Rev. 8:10-11)</p><p class="P3">The meaning of these verses is less clear than the previous ones. Therefore I will only give a possible exegesis:</p><p class="P3">In 1985, a nuclear reactor in Chernobyl, Ukraine melted down releasing a massive dose of radiation. Interestingly, the word Chernobyl is <span class="T17">translated as</span> <span class="T1">wormwood</span>. Since the accident, the reactor has been buried in concrete known as Chernobyl's Sarcophagus to protect the world from the radiation that is still emanating from the reactor. In the years following the disaster the sarcophagus has become unstable and the concrete is beginning to crack. There is no guarantee that at some future date the sarcophagus will not collapse and release the radiation simmering inside. </p><p class="P3">Perhaps the passage in Revelation 8:10, 11 means that a splinter from the comet might strike the sarcophagus and destroy it. If this were to occur then the second Chernobyl catastrophe would be much worse than the first. The weather patterns would result in a great outburst of radioactive dust that will settle into the water table thus making nearly all of the water in Europe undrinkable, causing many to die. It is also possible that in addition to the radiation there are other toxic gases that have been building for decades, just waiting for the moment of its release. The Bible mentions that the water will have a noticeably bitter taste.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="T3">The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn't shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.</span>” (Rev. 8:12)</p><p class="P3">Because of the vast amounts of cosmic dust accompanying the comet as it heats up, along with the smoke from the burned cities and forests, the atmosphere will become less transparent and the particulates will reflect back the sun’s visible light rays. In fact the dust and smoke particles will become so dense that visibility will be reduced by one third. </p><p class="P3">Because of this, a long extremely cold winter will settle over the whole Earth. Everything will be frozen, killing most of the surviving people, plants and animals.</p><p class="P3">“<span class="T3">I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!</span>” (Rev. 8:13)</p><p class="P3">These verses say that the catastrophes which will soon follow will make what has just occurred seem tame by comparison. However, the following texts in this area are much harder to understand. Therefore, I now lay aside my exegesis.</p><h1 class="P32"><a id="a_Chapter_13_Further_readings"><span>Chapter 13 </span></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc3994_504194157"/><a id="chap_Further"/>Further readings</h1><p class="P3">I have not put into this book a commentary on Mt. 10:33; Mrk. 8:38; Luk. 9:26; Luk. 12:8-9 and some other verses.
